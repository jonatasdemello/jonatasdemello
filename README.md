The X-shaped individual refers to the type of person who is good at working in multiple areas. The term is used to directly refer to those employees who are excellent manager material. The multiple arms of the X represent a person with good interpersonal skills and can work with different people across different industries or areas of a company. They are then able to bring such different groups together (indicated by the cross-section of the X) so that they can collaborate effectively.
